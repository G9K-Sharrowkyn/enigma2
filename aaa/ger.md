Corey John Stockdale not true

Corey John Stockdale Please elaborate and give a rationale on how it compares to the holocaust and the German invasion of Poland.

Christer Landén
Krzysztof Kolber are you that stupied that you dont get my point ? <mark>Polen got paid from Germany times over.</mark> It stops here. You see you pick any point in history and claim.

Krzysztof Kolber
Christer Landén when exacly did we get paid by Germany? Do you know the scale of destruction, how many poles were killed bt germans? When i have no information about something, im not trying to act if i know shit. You should do the same.

Bartosz Sowa

Christer Landén Historical facts from the Moomin Valley 

Christer Landén
Mateusz Franczak I am Swede. We fund Polen like Germany so Polen can be net receiver in EU funds. We open up your borders so Poles could make money abroad. Before that you would still live among tve goats in Polan as during the Russian time of yours.

Jem Pizzę
Christer Landén you killed 40% our population (and you are proud of this), so you should pay and apologize

Christer Landén
Cezary Lora no that is Finland Moomin coming from. Yes I know your general knowledge is kind basic shall we say. It is ok

Michał Lebioda
Christer Landén u stupid or What? Your country destroyed Poland more in XVII century than Nazis during WW2

Christer Landén
Jem Pizzę yes we are sorry but kind of stupied to attack Sweden. To what country should Polen pay and apologize to ? You attacked Sweden along with Russia 1700. Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia ? My point is this is never ending story. It needs to end

Christer Landén
Michał Lebioda but I as Swede do not owe YOU a shit ! Polen invaded Sweden in 1500s so bad idea. The fan hit you back

Tomasz Kaszteranda
many people defending Germans from the same countries that attacked us for centuries, Muslims will show you your place somewhere

Edvarts Zvirbulis
Visegrad24 What happened there? Why exactly would wanna annex it? Cause i heard polishjewish partisans commited genocide there, on germans... war rattling... i mean, England wanted it so bad.... uhhhh, all the idiots wanted it so bad..... for nearly 10 years Hitler wanted to calm all the idiots, no? How about you all start paying some mind... <mark>holocaust... thanks to the slightly excessive bombardment</mark> supply lines collapsed to the extent that everybody died in camps? No? Does not make sense... that is your holocaust... you are stupid. And whos fool are you>?
That is why we live in this fake clown world... pay. Idiots, you pay, everyday you pay.... life quality, firstly... and you also pay, with money too... to whom?
Now Poland knows communism very well, as they were first to get thrown under the bus meant for useful idiots, on a national scale.
Funny how evident is the corruption of the narrative... even AI cant straight up tell you something oh so crucial. WHY.
Hey, stupids, maybe start fighting each other over who gonna pay whom for what? Guess who would love that!?

Milewski Paweł
Christer Landén did you pay for Sweden invaiding Poland ?

Christer Landén
Milewski Paweł did you pay for Poland attacked Sweden 1700?

Chris Colebrook
Milewski Paweł wait what did the vikings do or I am missing something?

Jan Kowalski
Krzysztof Kolber western and northern part of Poland.

Jan Kowalski
Krzysztof Kolber tell me, how many were killed by Germans and how many by Russians? How many women were raped by Germans, how many by Russians? How many land were stolen by russians, and how many we got from Germans? How much politic of German were changed and how much by russia? How many german investitions and work place we have thanks to Germany and how many thanks to russia? How much money were given to Poland after joining UE and how much from russia?

Edvarts Zvirbulis
Visegrad24 Yeah, you should start paying... Poland. Because, as i heard, Hitler said, if they would lose, in a 100 years there wont be Europe. Well, 80 has passed... i think it is evident, and nothing really to theorize about.
I guess the untermenschen won... now you have streets filled with those in major euro citys, as degeneracy in normalized... congratz Poland, you look good now, in contrast. But are you really? Its amazing how much can a death of a good man change in the world... cause there was a man for peace with Germany, in Poland... but he died, too soon.
Too bad i cant give the quote, as i wiped my drive, but... the goal is to have a mass of people, too stupid to grasp anything, but good enough to work - that is a nice little marxist dream, euroasian negroid... also something about Europe never again competing for world domination... as if that is something to aspire to, as i think, the history shows the fate of empires, and the true cost can be comprehended.... but hey, there are retards out there, late to the party, and they wanna get some too!
The point of repentance, i guess, is to avoid a point that is too late, as Germany was... rest of the world was...

John E Welser
Krzysztof Kolber google the information: how much did germany pay to poland directly or indirectly in reparations

KelvinSheena Scott
Visegrad24 for the part they played as not everyone was anti nazi,

Christer Landén
Piotr Makarewicz I like Poland. Great People I am not supporting the islamation of Europe. But that does give Polen right to get reperations 80 years after the war. We have draw a line

Darek Pierchała
Christer Landén oh yeah? Sweden agression on Poland in 1655-1660 was one of biggest atack in Polish history and you wan money? Dumb or just stupid, witch you are?

Rafał Karol
Christer Landén okay, so give back our national treasures that your great grandparents took from us in the 1600s

Cezary Lora
Christer Landén no, no, I just meant that he tells fairy tales.

Christer Landén
Jaroslaw Dankowski so what has that fo with this ? Learn your own history. Do you know many times Pimoland has attacked Sweden ? Before what you call Swdish deluge Poland had attacked Sweden 2 times. Last attacked was by Poland in 1700. So moron give to your fucking victimhood !

Cezary Lora
Christer Landén The Russian occupation of Ukraine and most of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania posed a threat to Swedish influence in the Baltic Sea and was the direct cause of the Swedish invasion of Poland and Lithuania in 1655. You should probably go back to school though 

Wojtek Vir
Christer Landén w imieniu licznego i nie wymierającego narodu polskiego mówię: dziękuję

Cezary Lora
Christer Landén Dude, you can't even read with understanding and you're going to lecture me about history.

Cezary Lora
Christer Landén Poles never launched a full-scale invasion or raid on Swedish territory. Polish-Swedish conflicts in the 16th and 17th centuries (including the Swedish Deluge of 1655–1660) were fought primarily over Livonia and influence in the Baltic Sea basin, with fighting usually taking place on Polish, Lithuanian, or Livonia lands. I recommend eating less butter because it's bad for your memory 

Milewski Paweł
Chris Colebrook 1655 1660 5 y war. 40% of Poland destroyed and 50% of the valubales stolen.

Cezary Lora
Christer Landén From us, the only reparations you can get are those that Stefan Czarniecki presented to you.

Jaroslaw Dankowski
Christer Landén Learn history. It was Sweden that attacked Poland, learn about the deluge, how much you robbed us. Pimoland? Did someone ever kicked your ass? Come over and we can talk live about who the moron is. Your country soon will be muslim land and then you will plead to come over to Poland. BTW, the deluge was before 1700. The swedish school seems not to be top in terms of history (and obviously math), that explains a lot.

Piotr Suda
Marek Czyzynski He meant what we call Potop Szwedzki. It's closest to 1500s we have any war with Sweden.

Piotr Bartnicki
Edward Brett So the Jews must pay much higher compensation to Poland for treason in the eastern territories, pointing out local elites to the Soviet occupiers, for the massacres of the villages of Koniuchy and Naliboki (in the context of Jedwabne) and for the post-war management of Stalinist crimes, torture and murder of Polish war heroes (in the context of the Kielce pogrom).

Piotr Makarewicz
Christer Landén the reason is very simple, Poland has never signed any agreement with Germany, not counting the puppet government during communism. Besides, my friend, Sweden destroyed and took more from Poland than Germany did during World War II. So most of exhibits
in the museum in Stockholm that you can see are stolen from Poland.Germany pays compensation to Jews and pensions to SS men to this day. I see no reason for them to finally settle their accounts with the Poles. Ta hand om dig

Christer Landén
Jaroslaw Dankowski yrs about the so called deluge. You learn to read. The wars PRIOR to that Poland attacked Sweden twice as well as the last one 1700. But idiot you are missing the point here. Poland has NO fucking right of war reperations after 80 years from Germany. If you claim that you are moron.

Christer Landén
Piotr Makarewicz soo what IDIOT it is over 300 years ago ! Remember last war we had Poland attacked Sweden and again you were defeated. My point is war reperations for Poland....fucking forget it !

Jaroslaw Dankowski
Christer Landén Honey, Poland didn't invade Sweden, nothing excuses the Deluge. Give us back what you stole. Learn that an intelligent man uses arguments, not insults. Ah, Yes, an intelligent man, you're neither of this. Of course we have right to demand reparations from Germany and yes, from Swedistan as well.

Mario Mario
Christer Landén but you're the pig and I'm not going to feed you

Radosław Bejma
Christer Landén seriously - have you been living under a rock? Haven’t you heard about the reparations paid by Germany to surviving Holocaust victims of the Jewish faith? If you’re promoting such an absurd thesis, then you surely haven’t heard either that in 2002 Germany concluded an agreement with Namibia to pay €1.1 billion. This was a consequence of acknowledging the genocide committed by Germany against the African peoples of the Herero and Namaqua between 1904 and 1908 (94 years later!). With this in mind - are Poles somehow worse than Namibians and Jews? Or are you suggesting that Germany should stop paying money to those people?

Christer Landén
Radosław Bejma Yes. Poland You have had enough. It is called Pommern, Schleisen, Masurien etc and 74 Billlion Euro already paid plus the wellfare the North of Europe is paying you as a net receiver of EU funds. And no just because these areas was Polish for 800 years ago it was not Polish in 1945. You have had enough. Time to draw a line. Or perhaps it is time for the polish to pay reperations to the jews also after centuries of pogroms ? Or to Czech for the Zalozile region in 1938 while cutting up Czechslovakia along with Hitler ? Or the Lituanians in 20s or for the attack on Sweden in 170O ? You cant cherry picking the parts of history you like for own benefit ! Time draw a line and move on from all old war reperations or it will never end !

Radosław Bejma
Christer Landén this is a textbook example of false equivalence and historical cherry-picking.
First, the claim that Poland has “already been paid” €74 billion in reparations is simply false. There has never been any comprehensive bilateral reparations settlement between Germany and Poland for WWII comparable to those made to other victims. EU cohesion funds are not reparations - they are treaty-based structural funds benefiting the entire EU single market, including Germany, which is one of their biggest net beneficiaries through exports and investment returns. Conflating EU funds with war reparations is intellectually dishonest.
Second, pointing to territories such as Pomerania or Silesia misses the point entirely. Poland did not “receive” these lands as compensation — they were part of the post-war order imposed by the Allied powers after Germany started and lost a war of annihilation. Territorial changes are not reparations for the unprecedented destruction, loss of life, cultural eradication, and economic ruin inflicted on Poland, which proportionally suffered some of the highest losses of any country in WWII.
Third, dragging in medieval wars, 18th-century conflicts, or interwar regional disputes (Sweden in 1700, Lithuania in the 1920s, Zaolzie in 1938) is a red herring. Modern reparations law is based on 20th-century international law, state responsibility, documented crimes, and surviving victims — not on endlessly rewinding history to the Middle Ages. By that logic, no modern legal order could exist at all.
Fourth, invoking pogroms to suggest that Poland should pay reparations to Jews is deeply misleading. The Holocaust was a state-organized, industrial genocide carried out by Nazi Germany, not by the Polish state, which did not even exist as a sovereign entity during the war and whose population — including millions of non-Jewish Poles — was itself a primary victim of German terror. Individual crimes and antisemitism, where they occurred, do not equate to state responsibility for genocide.
Finally, “drawing a line” cannot be demanded selectively. Germany itself has acknowledged that genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity do not expire - which is exactly why it continues to pay reparations to Holocaust survivors and reached an agreement with Namibia. Either this principle applies universally, or it is abandoned universally. You cannot defend reparations in one case and dismiss them in another simply because it is politically inconvenient.
So no - this is not about “cherry-picking history for benefit.” It is about consistency, legal responsibility, and historical facts.
And those facts do not support your argument.

Maria Georgescu Najpierw to się z Niemcami dogadali i razem rozgrabili Polske, znasz pakt Ribbentrop-Mołotow? Jak Niemcy zerwali pakt i na nich napadli, to się nagle nawrócili by ostatecznie zagrabić wschodnią Europę po ustaleniach naszych zach. tzw. sojuszników w Jałcie, Poczdamie. Jak zwykle nas zdradzono.

Jami Bourriaque
￼ During the initial phase of WWII (1939-1941), Germany and the Soviet Union committed severe atrocities, including mass killings of civilians and prisoners of war (POWs), systematic violence, and deportations. Germany focused on ethnic cleansing and antisemitism, while the USSR engaged in targeted executions and forced deportations in occupied territories.

It's just empty talking to get people gullible enough to vote for them, and this is the easy way. They always only attack Germany because "evil Germany" will never actually bite back for the threats, and will keep cooperating peacefully with Poland even if they get called killers and dictators everyday.

Annexed by Germany from Poland hundreds years ago

Jan Kowalski
Piotr Moskala Poland wasn’t exist for longer time than exist today. On the same principle of thinking Silesia can be reborn and take their lands. Or Prussia, or maybe Czechs will demand Wratislav?
The Poland as a country not Kingdom, exist only 108 years. And in that time when we finally have administration, and nation ( there was no polish nation concept before 1918) and we start to exist on maps, we didnt poses lands on north and west. It was given to us after WW2. This lands belonged to Germany. But after 1918 we have had lands on east. It was taken from us by USSR. And now we can discuss if this lands were occupied by polish kingdom or belonged to us, etc. The same arguments and claims over the centuries can make Poland greater or disapear at all.
It’s a lie and a myth that these are reclaimed lands. These are lands obtained as REPARATIONS after WW2. And today’s claims from centuries ago of the descendants of slaves who were just livestock as chicken or pig, are ridiculous and cringy.

Jan Kowalski widzę kolega w polskim interesie rozpoczął negocjacje

Jan Kowalski
Paweł Kurkowski w Polskim interesie to jest utrzymywać jak najlepsze stosunki z naszym zachodnim sąsiadem. Plucie na Niemcy i Ukrainę przy jednoczesnej wojnie na wschodzie i snucie ruskich narracji o wyjściu z Unii, to przepis na oczywistą katastrofę. Już to przerabialiśmy i zniknęliśmy ze świata na ponad 120 lat. Dziś idziemy w tym samym kierunku. Znowu pseudopatrioci z głupoty lub za ruble pchają nas w łapy ruskich.
Polacy są odklejeni ze swoimi mitami i to się skończy dla wszystkich Polaków tragicznie. Nie będę miał satysfakcji, twierdząc „a nie mówiłem”, kiedy tak do siebie zbrzydzimy zachodnią Europę, że wszyscy machną na nas ręką kiedy Polska stanie się drugą Białorusią. A stanie się, jeśli większość będzie dalej pluć na zachód bardziej, zamiast zacząć odrobinę myśleć jaka przyszłość nas czeka poza UE.

Jan Kowalski
Paweł Kurkowski I zobaczysz, że Poznań, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz i zapewne górny Śląsk nie zechcą być w ruskiej orbicie. Więc Polacy ani nie dostaną reparacji od Niemców a jeszcze z pocałowaniem ręki sami zechcą stać się ich częścią jeśli homo sovieticus ze wschodu stwierdzą że u ruskich jest fajniej. Dokładnie to miało miejsce przed rozbiorami. I dokładnie tak samo zaściankowe, tchórzliwe i zdradzieckie tendencje Polaków do rozbiorów doprowadziły.

Below are approximate percentage shares of the different funding sources of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. These figures are indicative estimates based on publicly available information, as there is no official percentage breakdown of the Museum’s budget.
Estimated funding shares:
Based on publicly available information, the funding of the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum is financed predominantly by the Polish state. Approximately 70–90% of the Museum’s operating budget is covered by direct subsidies from the Polish state budget, which finance day-to-day maintenance, staff salaries, and regular operations.
An additional 9–29% of funding is provided through the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, which supports long-term conservation and preservation projects. These funds come from international contributions, including those made by Germany as part of historical commitments.
However, German contributions do not constitute regular funding for the Museum’s operational budget. In recent years, they have represented only a symbolic share of current operating costs, in some cases amounting to approximately 0.3%.
Other sources, such as European Union funding, private donations, and project-based grants, play a minor or variable role and depend on specific conservation or educational projects.
These figures are indicative estimates rather than official budgetary percentages, as the exact proportions vary from year to year depending on project financing and international support.
Explanatory notes
Poland covers the vast majority of the Museum’s operational costs, including daily maintenance, staff salaries, and ongoing activities.
The Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation primarily supports long-term conservation and preservation of authentic site structures, funded by contributions from many countries, with Germany being the largest historical donor.
In recent years, funds from the Foundation (including German contributions) have represented only a relatively small share of the Museum’s current operating budget, in some periods amounting to merely symbolic percentages of operational expenditure.
These figures are general estimates. Actual percentages vary year by year and depend on specific grants, conservation projects, and levels of international support.

The Soviet Union (Russia) invaded Poland on September 17, 1939, joining the German invasion that had begun on September 1, 1939. Following the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Red Army invaded from the east while Germany invaded from the west, splitting Poland between them by October 6, 1939.

Major atrocities included the Katyn massacre of ~22,000 officers and officials, and thousands more died during mass deportations to Siberia.

And also if you would opened your history, book reparations were paid to Poland by Germany through a waiver in 1953 later reconfirmed at in 1990 for 2+4 verification treaty haven’t paid bills in compensations to individuals however, Poland disputes these arguing that 1953 waiver was used under Soviet COERCION leading to renew demands for roughly $1.4 trillion in 2022 through 2023 ￼￼

Niemieckie wielkie firmy, koncerny jak np. Simens wzbogaciły się na przymusowej niewolniczej pracy Polaków. Dziś Niemcy mają majątek który nam odebrali. Zrównali z ziemią naszą stolicę. Odbudowaliśmy ją sami z riun. Czy zbrodnia taka jak teraz w Gazie ma się przedawnić?

**Auschwitz – a German death camp and the first prisoners (1940–1941)**
Auschwitz was a **German concentration camp and death camp**, established and run by the Germans on occupied Polish territories. From the very beginning it served as an instrument of terror against the Polish population, and only later became the main site of the extermination of European Jews.
The first transport of prisoners arrived at Auschwitz on **14 June 1940**. It consisted of **728 Poles** brought from the prison in Tarnów. This day is regarded as the beginning of the camp’s operation. In the years **1940–1941, mainly Poles were sent to Auschwitz**, as the camp was intended to break the resistance of Polish society and destroy its elites.
**In the period 1940–1941, those imprisoned and murdered there were primarily Poles:**
* members of the Polish resistance movement
* Polish soldiers of the September Campaign
* the Polish intelligentsia: teachers, students, clergy, officials
* Polish scouts and youth
* Poles accused of “anti-German activity”
Poles were murdered through **executions, starvation, disease, exhausting forced labor, and torture**. Auschwitz functioned as a **German camp of terror and extermination**, whose aim was to intimidate and subjugate the Polish nation.
Only from **1942**, after the expansion of the camp with Birkenau, did Auschwitz become a site of mass, industrial extermination of Jews. However, its first victims were Poles, and the beginnings of the camp are inseparably linked with German policies of crimes against Poland. #GermanDeathCamps

Why don't they ask Russia  for reparations first?

Piotr Guzik
per GROK:
"Since the year 966, Poland has never launched a major, unprovoked invasion deep into core German territory for conquest; Polish offensives were typically defensive counterattacks, border recoveries (e.g., against Teutonic incursions), or limited frontier actions. In total, there have been roughly 8–12 major named wars or prolonged conflict series (depending on how one groups phases and border skirmishes), with Germans/German states as the aggressor in most large-scale invasions or territorial seizures, while Poland occasionally initiated limited campaigns for western border security or tribute. The pattern reflects Poland's vulnerable position between powerful western (German) and eastern (Russian) neighbors, with the 1939 invasion and WWII occupation marking the peak of devastation."

Jack Biernack
Piotr Guzik when Poland had their own empire were the people under it treated fairly? Ukrainians , Belarusians, etc. Are we only victims of History?

Piotr Guzik
Jack Biernack per GROK: "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), often considered Poland's "empire" era at its peak (a vast multi-ethnic federation stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea), treated its subjects unevenly based on social class, religion, and ethnicity rather than outright fairness or equality by modern standards.Religious tolerance was relatively high for the time: The 1573 Warsaw Confederation guaranteed freedom of religion to nobles (and to some extent burghers), allowing Orthodox Christians (the majority faith among Ruthenians/Ukrainians and Belarusians), Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and others to coexist with less persecution than in many contemporary European states — though tensions rose later, especially after the 1596 Union of Brest created the Greek Catholic (Uniate) Church, which some Orthodox viewed as forced Polonization.
Social structure was highly hierarchical and exploitative: The szlachta (nobility, mostly Polish and Lithuanians, but including some Ruthenian elites who Polonized) enjoyed extensive privileges ("Golden Liberty"), while the vast majority of peasants — including ethnic Poles, Lithuanians, Ruthenians (ancestors of modern Ukrainians and Belarusians) — were enserfed from the 16th century onward. Serfdom intensified dramatically in the east (Ukraine/Belarus lands), with peasants bound to the land, obligated to heavy labor (often 5–6 days/week), and subject to noble whims; this was harsher in the Ukrainian frontier than in central Poland due to magnate estates and efforts to maximize grain exports.
For Ukrainians (Ruthenians/Cossacks/peasant population in the southeast): Treatment was often seen as particularly unfair. Many Cossacks (originally semi-autonomous frontier warriors, many runaway serfs) faced restrictions on their rights and numbers (only a limited "registered" group recognized), while unregistered ones were pushed into serfdom. This, combined with cultural/religious pressures (Polonization attempts, land grabs by Polish magnates), economic exploitation, and denial of noble status, fueled repeated Cossack uprisings (e.g., 1591–1593, 1637–1638) and culminated in the massive Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648–1657) — a brutal peasant-Cossack revolt against Polish rule that devastated the Commonwealth, involved widespread massacres (including of Jews and Poles), and led to the loss of much Ukrainian territory to Russia via the 1654 Pereiaslav Agreement.
For Belarusians (Ruthenians in the northern/eastern parts): Conditions were somewhat less explosive than in Ukraine — fewer large-scale revolts, more integration of local nobility into the Commonwealth system — but serfdom still applied heavily to peasants, with similar economic burdens and gradual cultural/linguistic pressures toward Polish dominance among elites.
Overall, the Commonwealth was progressive in religious pluralism and noble democracy compared to absolutist neighbors, but it was far from "fair" to non-noble subjects, especially eastern peasants and Cossacks, where class-based exploitation (serfdom) overlapped with ethnic/religious tensions, leading to resentment, uprisings, and long-term historical grievances in Ukrainian and (to a lesser extent) Belarusian national narratives that often portray it as colonial or oppressive rule by Polish lords. Modern assessments vary: Poles may highlight its multiculturalism and tolerance, while Ukrainians frequently emphasize social injustice and national oppression as seeds of later conflicts."

Jack Biernack
Piotr Guzik fair points born in Przemysl Poland never felt from relatives any love for Ukrainians. However my father thought Poles never treated them well, which was foolish since both people were between the powers of Russia and Germany.

---------------

Rob Fairley
Piotr Guzik What about Polands “full scale” invasion of Russia in 1609?

Piotr Guzik
Rob Fairley per GROK:
"The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's full-scale invasion of Russia in 1609 (starting with the siege of Smolensk under King Sigismund III Vasa) was primarily prompted by Tsar Vasili IV Shuisky's military alliance with Sweden (signed February 28, 1609), which Sigismund viewed as a direct threat to Polish interests—especially his own ambitions to reclaim the Swedish throne (as a Vasa dynasty member deposed from Sweden)—while also exploiting Russia's ongoing Time of Troubles (civil chaos, famine aftermath, pretender crises like the False Dmitrys, and boyar factions) to pursue territorial gains (e.g., recovering Smolensk and other borderlands lost earlier), weaken a potential Swedish ally, and install Sigismund himself or his son Władysław on the Russian throne for greater influence or even a personal union. Earlier Polish involvement (via private noble support for the False Dmitrys from 1605–1609) had been opportunistic and unofficial, but the Swedish-Russian pact gave Sigismund the pretext and Sejm approval for open royal intervention in September 1609.

Perhaps it's time to understand why those similar groups are treated as such solely to prevent future hardships.

Marek Ankudowicz
Chris Colebrook Listen, there were never any Polish concentration camps in real life. They were GERMAN concentration camps built by the Germans in then-occupied Poland. Millions of Poles and Jews lost their lives at German hands. German institutions and corrupt politicians deliberately distort these words. Instead of saying "German" death camps, they say "Polish" and then apologize, saying it was an accident. These are the first attempts to distort history.

Chris Colebrook

Chris Colebrook who built the camps? Was Poland an independent country? Polish people build them to murder other Polish people? Are you serious? Germans built the first death camps in Namibia, so they were Namibian, according to this logic....And if you use the phrase "Polish camps" it implies the ownership not the location.
You miss the point. They were death camps!

Katarzyna Gębka
Chris Colebrook the fact that concentration camp Auschwitz was built on OCCUPIED TERRITORIES doesn't make ot Polish, as it was fully built and administrated by GERMANY. I know you may become wet when you think about Mengele or Hoess but they were Germans, they are responsible for the death of about 6 millions innocent people, they brought a war to Polish land, Holocaust was GERMAN idea and GERMAN invention. It's 21 centiry and I am still shocked when ignorant can't find sources and understand the circumstances.

Zbigniew Golemienko
Nikola Petrovic thats not how it works xD Poland after WW II is smaller than it was before it, and just because germans commited genocides before in history and eradicted Baltic Prussians doesnt exactly give them moral high ground to claim those lands xD oldest cities in eastern Germany were built around Polabian strongholds.

Nikola Petrovic
Zbigniew Golemienko Did Poland payed reparations to Russia because of occupation of Moscow in 1613? I mean, if we are guiding ourselves with that logic, you should pay it. Silesia and Pomerania were ethnically German, you sent those people to Germany, cleansed the area, and you got much better land than that land in the east. Also eastern Poland pre WWII was not ethnically Polish at all. Only Lwiw and Wilno and their surounding. If Germany is to pay Poland reparations for WW2, then why not paying every nation? They ravaged my country also, Serbia!

I despise idiots like you!

I think it's completely ignorant i idiotic to go back to 1940s and ask for reparations from the country you took land from which amounts half of your country now. I mean really.

Peter Rymasz
Nikola Petrovic Not really. Slavic tribes settled in Pomerania in the 5th-6th century. Pomerania comes from the Slavic Language "po more - eng. by the sea". Then the Piast dynasty (Polish) ruled Silesia and Pomerania in the 10th-11th centuries until it was colonised by Czech, Germans and Austrians, who had always tried to conquer these regions violently. These regions did not willingly join Bohemia, Austria or Prussia (Germany).

Nikola Petrovic i dont know who raised you to be a german cuckold but Pomerania and Silesia literally have their own distinct dialects/languages which are Slavic and both survived exactly because local population was fighting against germanization so much. There is still small population of original inhabitants of modern day saxony who, surprise, also speak very old Slavic language. There is no point in discussing someone with his cuckold agenda though.

Zbigniew Golemienko Nope you're wrong. Im just saying you're the hypocrites now, im not siding with the Germans, I'll always be by your side.

Zbigniew Golemienko
Nikola Petrovic if someone wants reperations from Poland they may ask for it. You are wrong by claiming Poland has no rights to reperations. And your argumentation is pure retardation.

Krzysztof A. Ziembik
Nikola Petrovic Poland was pushed to get Silesia, Pomerania, Masuria and Lubusz Voivodeships by USSR. This wasn't compensation from Germany. The USSR simply gave back larger and better Polish lands in the East in exchange for the stolen lands. The Germans settled accounts with the USSR, but not with us.

Zbigniew Golemienko
Krzysztof A. Ziembik exactly, the eastern lands are where all the farming takes place. Also reperations are not about land but about paying off for all things stolen, all things turned to rubble, all those people murdered etc. There are Polish stolen paintings comming out on auctions all the time.

Sven Kunert
Zbigniew Golemienko Then you shouldnt have signed the paper in 1953. But you did. So the topic reparations is closed and over.

Nikola Petrovic The western territories were not a “gift” to Poland.
• They were taken from Germany by a decision of the Allied powers after World War II.
• They were compensation for:
• Germany’s aggression in 1939
• the destruction of the Polish state
• approximately 6 million victims (including about 3 million Polish Jews)
• the loss of Poland’s eastern territories to the USSR

Nikola Petrovic
Remigiusz Kucharski Exactly. So why the reparations then? You have just said by yourself.

Remigiusz Kucharski
Nikola Petrovic What Germany did to Poles and other nations of Europe is beyond any price or compensation for families and loved ones.
It was the greatest act of brutality in world history.

Nikola Petrovic
Remigiusz Kucharski Exactly. So why asking for reparations now? And why should Poland get the reparations but other countries wont? Because now you feel strong right?

Remigiusz Kucharski
Nikola Petrovic Of course, I believe that everyone who suffered deserves compensation — both the victims and their families and loved ones.
In addition, Germany should return everything that was looted. To this day, German museums are full of artworks and objects stolen from Poland.

Remigiusz Kucharski
Nikola Petrovic This has nothing to do with “feeling strong now.” It’s about unresolved legal and moral responsibility.
Poland never received real WWII reparations.The question “why now” is valid because the losses are documented, their effects persist, and Germany acknowledges historical responsibility — selectively.
Other countries are irrelevant. Reparations are case-specific, and time does not erase responsibility for genocide, deliberate destruction, and millions of deaths.

Zbigniew Jaworski
Nikola Petrovic stupid idiot 

André Luis
Nikola Petrovic, Germany shouldn't exist in the map anymore.

Tomasz Puchalski
Nikola Petrovic Then look how many Polish lands Stalin took from Poland. He incorporated them into the USSR. All the lands you mentioned were never German, even near Berlin. Slavs, Lusitanians, always lived there. The Germans came to these lands. These weren't Germanic lands. All of Brandenburg was Slavic land.

Adam Kupiec
Nikola Petrovic Berin budowali słowiqnie zachodni,wiec dawać Berlin bo jest Polski.

Anna Piatko
Dinu Yadin Oświęcim? You mean, Auschwitz. Respectfully, you are wrong to blame victims and paint them as co-aggressors. Shame on you. POLAND paid and continues to pay holocaust survivors. That was Germany’s responsibility. Poles who lost their lives at the hands of Nazi Germany were not compensated. They stayed, suffered some more when we were sold out by the Allies. Many Jews that survived left the country for the US and Israel- and were compensated for the rubble left behind. Some stayed to rebuild. Compensation was fair and complete.

<mark>Germany paid reperations to ussr. So if Poland didnt get anything, go ask kremlin for it</mark>, as it got a Poland money also!

Krzysztof Żukowski
Andris Avotiņš like you sed - "Germany paid reperations to ussr." Not to Poland - end of story - start pay.
By the way, when will the Germans finally return Polish works of art and monuments?

Andris Avotiņš
Ussr controlled Poland after ww2 didnt it? So the reperations, which also includes money meant for Poland, was taken by kremlin. That also includes my country money. All reperations went to moscow bank. As for work of art and monuments, there i could agree with you.

Conrad Wyszomirski
Andris Avotiņš Yes, because Stalin made Roosevelt and Churchill look like idiots and took Poland, bulgaria, and hungary and some other countries and forced communism on them. Had Truman let Patton go into Moscow and destroy Russia like he wanted, Poland would of been free after 1945 along with the others.

Andris Avotiņš
Conrad Wyszomirski Western countries wouldnt spill their blood for us, not back then, and its naive to hope they would even today! France, Belgium, Netherlands.. those are important countries for them, they were liberated, but as for rest of Europe, thats not in their concern.

---------------

Bogusław Paź
Andris Avotiņš Germany invaded Poland and murdered 6 million Poles, so Poland was and is the recipient of reparations. If Germany paid these reparations to someone else, it is Germany's problem, not Poland's. And they can ask the Germans to return the money to the Russians, not Poland.

Andris Avotiņš
Bogusław Paź A thing is that after ww2 nobody talked with Poland about reperations. Ussr together with other Allies simply put a check on a table and it was signed. So a money, that was also meant for Poland recovery, was given to ussr, cos Poland was under ussr direct control. In that way ussr was responsible to invest reperations to recover all those teritories, that was destroyed in a war. Wasnt Poland rebuilt under ussr? So if there is some doubts on how honest that reperations was spent, i think most logical would be to ask kremlin about it, cos Germany paid a price, that was asked. Germany didnt even had the option to directly pay Poland or any other ussr controlled teritory. So why should Germany pay once more to Poland, just cos kremlin didnt share reperations?

Bogusław Paź

Wina – Niemcy zostały zmuszone do przyjęcia winy za rozpoczęcie wojny na mocy artykułu 231 traktatu, znanego jako Klauzula Winy Wojennej. Reparacje – Niemcy miały zostać zobowiązane do zapłaty za szkody poniesione przez Wielką Brytanię i Francję podczas wojny. W 1922 roku kwota do zapłaty została ustalona na 6,6 miliarda funtów.

Aspen Dunn Germany is not a brother, the only thing they want is to squeeze money out of every single UE member. When war is over, they will make business with Russia again. Remember Nord stream 2? Think about it. Every single country that was attacked by Germany got reparations beside Poland. They killed 3 milions of poles, robbed thousands of art pieces, gold and gave nothing back. Did not even pay a single euro to the people that survived the horror they made to them and you tell us something about brotherhood? Don’t be a fool. If one single occasion comes they will turn their back to us.

You’re talking about the existing government, not the people. Of course the governments of Europe are destroying us.

Tomasz Puchalski
Andreas Hart What nonsense are you talking about? What kind of population was deported to Germany? Poles came to these areas from the eastern lands stolen by Stalin. All the industrial goods were taken home by Russians in wagons or by Americans.

Andreas Hart
Tomasz Puchalski not my statement... It is purely yours.

Tomasz Puchalski
Based on a comprehensive report released by the Polish government in September 2022, Poland estimates its financial losses during the German occupation in World War II (1939–1945) to be 8
6.2 trillion zlotys, which was equivalent to approximately €1.3 trillion ($1.32 trillion to $1.5 trillion USD depending on the exchange rate at the time).
Here are the key details regarding the estimation:
Components of Loss: The estimated 6.2 trillion zlotys figure includes 797 billion zlotys in material losses (infrastructure, buildings, industry) and over 4.7 trillion zlotys in losses related to human life and GDP, including potential income lost by the more than 5 million citizens who perished.
Human Cost: The report emphasizes the loss of over 5.2 million Polish citizens.
Scope of Destruction: The report highlights that approximately 38% of Polish national assets were destroyed, along with 43% of cultural assets, 14,000 factories, 900,000 farmhouses, and 400,000 townhouses.
Status of Claims: While the previous Law and Justice (PiS) government formally demanded this amount from Germany in 2022, the German government has consistently maintained that the issue of reparations was legally settled in 1953, with the waiver confirmed in 1970 and 2004, and therefore considers the matter "closed".
Though the new government taking office in late 2023 changed the approach to the issue—focusing on "compensation" rather than "reparations"—the 2022 report remains the official, detailed, and comprehensive assessment of the war

Piotr Moskala
Andreas Hart Annexed by Germany from Poland hundreds years ago

Andreas Hart
Piotr Moskala Poland became a state in 1918. Before that turning point, and before 1848, everything was a patchwork of kingdoms, counties and free areas.... So define the exact regional claim you are talking about.

Piotr Moskala
Andreas Hart Oto tłumaczenie na angielski (wierne w tonie i treści):
“You are a complete dilettante and a historical illiterate. Poland was and is a state with a great history — with magnificent kings and a defender of Europe. Once Europe was saved by Sobieski and the Winged Hussars, and a second time by Piłsudski in the war against the Bolsheviks. For that, the Germans, Austrians, and Russians thanked us by destroying the country for 123 years. But Poland never died, and that is why we exist today.”

Andreas Hart
Piotr Moskala Celebrating national greatness is legitimate, but an honest history must also acknowledge the internal responsibility for decline and the dark sides of one's own power politics, instead of merely defining oneself through a role of victimhood...

Piotr Moskala
Andreas Hart “I don’t understand why you’re trying to justify the partition of someone else’s country  The same applies to the consequences of World War II — it wasn’t us who started the war, so responsibility for its consequences lies with the aggressor.”

Andreas Hart
Piotr Moskala could not find one of your answers anymore.... I don't defend or justify partition. Read my original first comment above, what you made out of it, that is not written there... Sorry guys

Conrad Wyszomirski
Andreas Hart Yes, Stalin manipulated Roosevelt and Churchill at Yalta. He played them to take Poland with Hungary, and others. Germany was rebuilt by the Marshall Plan and Roosevelt and Churchill were cowards to stand up to Stalin. Patton the war general hated Russia and wanted to remove Stalin but the moron Truman refused to let him go in Moscow and remove the Commies.

Tomasz Puchalski
Andreas Hart I am asking you about what population of East Germany did Poland gain, what did Germany give back to Poland, what industry did Poland gain after East Germany? Tell me, maybe after the war the entire German population was resettled to Germany. The industry was taken away by the Russians on rails wagons or by the Americans from their zones.So, I'm going to ask you where all the gold, silver, works of art from museums, marble, all the valuable things, books from libraries that the Germans took away in train vagons from Poland to Germany and not only from Poland but also from France, from the Netherlands, from other countries where they stole all these works of art. Did they ever return to their original places, where they were stolen from? Tell me why works of art still hang in the former fascist German homes of all these perpetrators.

Tomasz Puchalski
Andreas Hart
During World War II, the German occupation of Poland involved the systematic looting of cultural, artistic, and economic assets, with a significant portion transported to Germany by rail.
Total Rail Transport of Loot: While a precise, single number for all stolen goods is difficult to isolate, estimations indicate that during the early phase of the occupation, 10,000 train wagons filled with stolen property—including agricultural machinery, furniture, food, and other goods—were sent to Germany by the Wehrmacht by early November 1939.
Art and Cultural Theft: Over 516,000 individual items of art and historical value were taken from Poland.
Library and Document Losses: Approximately 22 million books and documents were lost or destroyed, with vast quantities of library collections and archives taken by the occupiers.
Scope of Plunder: The plunder included 11,000 paintings by Polish artists, 2,800 European paintings, 1,500 sculptures, 75,000 manuscripts, 25,000 maps, and 300,000 prints.
Gold and Valuables: The Nazis systematically looted banks and private collections, including gold, jewelry, and silver, often as part of the "Aktion Reinhard" campaign, with these items frequently transported by train.
Total Looting Statistics: Some estimates suggest that 43% of Poland's cultural artifacts were looted. Furthermore, reports of broader Nazi looting across Europe mention 1,418,000 railway wagons and 427,000 tonnes by ship in total.
The so-called "Nazi gold train" (or Wałbrzych gold train), often rumored to have carried vast treasures, is considered an urban legend by many historians, though it is symbolic of the massive, recorded theft of valuables from Poland.

Poland has to yet to answer for Treaty of Riga, when they sold eastern Ukraine to Russia and took western Ukraine themself.

So when will Poland finally pay for stealing the land of my forefathers in the 5th and 6th century when slavs moved to central Europe? After they payed for that and endless slavic raids on their neighbours we can speak about WW2.

Angelika Zofia
Lars Garnichda shut up german schwein

Tomasz Puchalski
Lars Garnichda The entire Brandenburg region was the land of the Lusatian Slavs, it was not previously Germanic land. The Germans had a policy of settling the land and considering it theirs.

Lars Garnichda
Tomasz Puchalski Read a book mate. Read a book about where slavs came from. Spoiler: it was not Brandenburg.

Tomasz Puchalski
Lars Garnichda After all, you Germans not only murdered people, not only Jews, you murdered Gypsies, Poles, Russians, you murdered prisoners of war, mentally ill people. You robbed, you took away works of art, gold, silver, furniture, bricks in railway carriages, you robbed entire nations, not only Poles, you started two world wars in the world, you were the largest barbaric, cruel group in the Roman Empire. You are responsible for two world wars. You have racism in your blood, you have hatred. You are the ones who exalt yourselves as a super race, you consider yourselves a superior race. Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, said about you that Germany, as an example, should be bombed every 50 years, as an example. You are the greatest pests of all of Europe, together with communist Russia. Germany has brought the greatest evil to all of Europe. You are responsible for the greatest misfortune. You have brought death, destruction, death to millions of people all over the world, not only to Jews, but you brought World War II to Europe. Give back to Poland the German thieves the works of art, gold, silver, tableware, furniture, marble that you stole. You barbarian thieves, the Germans, have smuggled out of the museums of Poland and Europe in railway carriages. And now you have brought the Fourth Reich to Europe in the guise of the European Union, robbing all of Europe economically.

Lars Garnichda
Tomasz Puchalski You seem pretty mad, bro.
