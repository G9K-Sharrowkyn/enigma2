Poland then attacked Germany. Though that's covered up now. Then AFTER Germany one they offered the rest of Poland back in exchange for peace. Poland refused. You were lied to.

**Jon Creighton**
> I don't live in your faggoty shit hole country. We have freedom of speech. We are the hegemony. Your pathetic meetings are beneath contempt. Because if you're jailed for speaking the truth. You're already in an open air prison. It's against the law because it's true. It threatens the lies that bind you.

**Jon Creighton**
> Auschwitz was simply an interment camp. Just like Roosevelt's here. You're hiding from the truth and being willfully ignorant. Why don't you cast off those laws?

**Daniel Schilling**
> Poland got large parts of eastern Germany!

**John Galtson**
> Poland got 100,000 kilometres of east Germany, thanks to Stalin. They should be grateful.

**Andreas Maxo**
> Maybe he wants to pay for Silesia, Pomerania, East Prussia…

**Nikola Petrovic**
> Okay but then Poland returns Silesia, Pomerania, Masuria and Lubusz Voivodeships to Germany. If that's not reparation I don't know what it is. This is hypocricy, really

**Scott Call**
> If Poland wants reparations, then they should return the land taken from Germany.

**Manfred Podzkiewitz**
> In 1945 Poland had become 117.000 square kilometers of high devoloped german territory. Including all houses, buildings, all industries, all natural and mineral resources. Thats a territory bigger than Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands together. So please be quiet.

**Andreas Hart**
> This is not right, because a guy like him simply forget that Post War Germany gave up for admin reasons a lot of territories including people, industry and regional wealth to Poland. Due to Russia. In 1990, the so called 2 plus 4 contract confirmed the temporary boarders of Poland as final.That was a lot...

**Robert Schmidt**
> If we add up all the money that went thru the EU out of the German pockets into Poland ....and by the way - if you want even more, than give back the land seized after WW2....

**Tanner Durham**

**Fina Rina**

**Dennis A. Brown**
> This same tit-for-tat mentality is what brought on WWII. Get over it! Go on with your lives and be productive in your lives!

**Kathy Pajorski**
> Sorry to have to say this, but exactly how far back in history do we take this need for Reparations????

**James Schofield**
> Reparations for historical events is the most retarded concept in this day and age.

## 7. Twierdzenia że obecne pokolenia nie ponoszą odpowiedzialności

**Emil Szczygiel**
> Let me get this right: German population ( who can not change the past - and got nothing to do what the ancestors did) should pay to people who got nothing to do with original cause…

**Mindy LaBarge**
> None of those same people are alive today. What he is asking is for innocent people to pay for something they are not responsible for.

## 8. Porównania do reparacji dla Afroamerykanów

**Ron Scoma**
> Throughout modern history 3 groups suffered more than any others. Blacks, Jews and Poles. They are very much the same in what they have in common. They all want money, deserved or not, from others for events that happened before those asking for the money, or providing the money, were even born. Perhaps it's time to understand why those similar groups are treated as such solely to prevent future hardships.

**Debi Bauscher Brierton**
> Just like black wanting reparations in America. Neither should be. It's all history. Bringing these things up just creates more hate.

**Attila Szakács**
> Can't wait to pay reparation to africans : me who never had slaves to those who never been slave.

## 9. Twierdzenia że Polska powinna się zwrócić do Rosji

## 10. Rasistowskie i obraźliwe komentarze o Polakach

**Tomas Mar**
> ￼Polish are Slavic manure and so not deserve anything.

**Tomas Mar**
> Poland should not exist, half of Poland belong to Germany, the other half to Russia

**Tomas Mar**
> Polish are like Russians

**Tomas Mar**
> nobody likes Polish, they smell and have no brains.

**Tomas Mar**
> Lithuania was much bigger an powerful than your stinky little Slavic manure shit hole Poland. You clearly do not know history Muscovite barbarian. Look at the map - the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and measly Polish tumor attached to it while Lithuania as building cities and castles, Polish peasants did not know how to wipe their asses, spoke tongue clicks and wore animal skins instead of clothes. Even today Polish are alcoholized Russians clones, savages without culture and identity, poor, and wit no significance to Europe other than being famous for their death camps, Nazi ideology and degradation. On the west you live on stolen German lands which will return soon back to mighty Germany and your shitty country will be part of Russia where it always belonged, as Easter Europe.

**Elena Orchard**
> yes coz they are joos or have a joo mentality

**Angel Tan**
> Polish pigs!

**Josip Miličević**

## 11. Kłamstwa o zrzeczeniu się reparacji

**Christer Landén**
> Polen got paid from Germany times over. It stops here. You see you pick any point in history and claim.

**Ilona Lonie**
> Germany have paid the reparation already however Soviet Union took these money away.

**Werner Vielhaber**
> Sollte es überhaupt möglich sein begangenes Kriegsunrecht durch "Bezahlung" wieder gut zu machen, dann hat Deutschland sicherlich durch die Abtretung von einem Drittel seiner damalige Staatsfläche an Polen alle "Schulden" mehr als wett gemacht. Ansonsten verweise ich auf die Historie: Potsdamer Abkommen 1945; Verzicht der polnischen Regierung 1953; Bestätigung des Verzichts durch die polnische Führung im Warschauer Vertrag 1970; 2+4-Vertrag 1990; Erklärung der polnischen Regierung 1991; Erklärung des polnischen Außenministerium 2006

## 12. Groźby i wrogość wobec Polski

> what ever helps to stop the endless stream of Polish tears is welcome.

**Lars Garnichda**
> So when will Poland finally pay for stealing the land of my forefathers in the 5th and 6th century when slavs moved to central Europe? After they payed for that and endless slavic raids on their neighbours we can speak about WW2.

**Phil East**
> Aren't polish scared they could get invaded again by germans if they continue with these attacks on germans and specially if u.s. leaves europe ?

**Michael Hollingshead**
> If the US pulled out of Europe the EU would crumble and a war would break out within twenty years. The European countries have a long history of not being able to get along. Just like the first two world wars, It would probably be Germany that decides to try round 3 and take back land from Poland. History always repeats itself.

**Rojo War Canine**
> Maybe Putin can have Poland

## 13. Negowanie Holocaustu i zbrodni niemieckich

**Edvarts Zvirbulis**
> holocaust... thanks to the slightly excessive bombardment supply lines collapsed to the extent that everybody died in camps? No? Does not make sense... that is your holocaust... you are stupid.

**Frank Johannes**
> Never believe what ever jews claim about WW-II, Auschwitz, Hitler etc forgeries, pathetic bullshit all along, psychological warfare to enforce the Banksters plunderdemocracy

---

## 14. Twierdzenia że Niemcy już wystarczająco płacą

**Carlito Steel**
> Always the same song, it's boring. Germany contributes enough to the World, it's the biggest contributor to the EU, and its one of the biggest payers in UN and NATO, OECD and IMF. Poland benefits from these payments. Especially the EU made Poland to that what it is now.

**Henry Lyatsky**
> Enough demagogy. Stop reducing WWII guilt to money. Poland got lots of real estate from Germany. Focus on building better countries and better Europe.

---

## 15. Obrażanie polskiego prezydenta

**Hal Bartek**
> He is clown not a President

**Ilona Lonie**
> This guy is a junky, former pimp and hooligan. He has now idea what he is talking about.

**Joanna Barszczewska**
> It is a fraud, not a president. Highly addicted human stain

**Michał Brum**
> Polish president is considered to be a nazi symphatiser, a pimp, and a thief who stole a small flat from the pool of public resources.

## 16. Ironiczne i sarkastyczne komentarze

**Cory Frazier**
> Trying to raise money to fly a rocket to the sun, at night of course.

**Cory Frazier**
> Oh just a joke, thanks for the information though, but to be honest I don't give a shit about Poland, Germany, or you. All three can kiss my ass.

**Matthias von Rosenheim**
> Cory Frazier Poles ain't dump, they know they'd burn if they tried to land on the sun at the daytime

**Saba Saba**
> Maybe by GAS ?

## 17. Wyciąganie historycznych przewinień Polski

**Christer Landén**
> Remember when Poles were in bed with Nazis and took pary of Czeckoslavika in 1938 ?

**Petr Vrublevskyi**
> Zbigniew Golemienko really?? Poland? Not Ukraine with 8-10 million dead, but Poland with 6? BTW, tell us more about Polish invasion to Czechoslovakia in 1938..

**Rob Fairley**
> Piotr Guzik What about Polands "full scale" invasion of Russia in 1609?

**Tomas Mar**
> Poland must pay reparations to Lithuania for 20 years or Vilnius occupation, breaching the Suwalki treaty, Dubingiai and Kaniukai massacres.

---

## 18. Współczesne ataki na Polskę

**Paweł Mizgalewicz**
> Yeah, but if they did the same to Russia there would be a risk of Russia actually reacting, and that's what they really don't want lol. It's just empty talking to get people gullible enough to vote for them, and this is the easy way. They always only attack Germany because "evil Germany" will never actually bite back for the threats, and will keep cooperating peacefully with Poland even if they get called killers and dictators everyday. Tell that to Russia, you might not wake up tomorrow lol.

**Jan Kowalski**
> Polacy są odklejeni ze swoimi mitami i to się skończy dla wszystkich Polaków tragicznie. Nie będę miał satysfakcji, twierdząc „a nie mówiłem", kiedy tak do siebie zbrzydzimy zachodnią Europę, że wszyscy machną na nas ręką kiedy Polska stanie się drugą Białorusią.

---

## 19. Szokujące historyczne rewizjonizmy

**Nikola Petrovic**
> Also eastern Poland pre WWII was not ethnically Polish at all. Only Lwiw and Wilno and their surounding. If Germany is to pay Poland reparations for WW2, then why not paying every nation? They ravaged my country also, Serbia!

**Damyan Danev**
> Today's Germans will answer that at that time their ancestors lived in the deserts and semi-deserts of the Middle East, Arabia and the rocks of Turkey.

---

## 20. Inne oburzające komentarze

**Triston Pike**
> He saw people in america wanting reperations and said "me too" I want to laugh but honestly, it's just sad and pathetic.

**Aspen Dunn**
> Anyone who agrees that this should happen is more concerned about the past than uniting us in the hard times we all face as the European peoples together. All of us are experiencing replacement, biological extermination, and you're more concerned about trying to squeeze money out of your European brothers?

**Darius Munteanu**
> Poland is too big. Slice it up

**Yavor Nedyalkov**
> Hitler will collapse in his grave people these days are delusional, definitely society needs another Hitler to put some order

**Bert Barker**
> germany should never been allowed to build up a military after the end of ww2 again,

**Brandon Michael**
> All the new muslim immigrants in Germany can pay since they wanna be citizens

**Cory Nelson**
> does he know only jews get reperations, nobody else

**Mario Alas**
> They deny being khazars but always want khazar benefits. Just admit it already. You people act like they can't see your noses or the fact that Israel always finds another pollack to make head of state…
