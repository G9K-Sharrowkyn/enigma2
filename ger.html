Visegrad24


Speaking at Auschwitz on the anniversary of the camp’s liberation, Polish President Karol Nawrocki has renewed calls for Germany to pay war reparations to Poland.
“To this day, the German state has not paid reparations to Poland for the evils of World War Two.”
“This is not how you build a world of peace. For every crime and every war, you simply have to pay and apologise. Only then will we be able to feel that we have fulfilled our duty.”
Jerguš Kukučka
Ok but Poland has to pay reparations too.


Marek Ankudowicz
Jerguš Kukučka Pay whom and for what?


Michael Lucas
Jerguš Kukučkafor what you fucking retard? Been reading the make believe history again?


Chris Colebrook
Jerguš Kukučka what about Ukraine paying reparations on that basis? Perhaps france to?

Visegrad24
For what exactly?


Corey John Stockdale
Visegrad24 tell me you don't know what happened between 1919 and 1935 without telling me. Hint Poland wasn't the good guy and neither was any one else.


Robert Gr
Corey John Stockdale not true


Clint Heine
Corey John Stockdale Please elaborate and give a rationale on how it compares to the holocaust and the German invasion of Poland.


Christer Landén
Visegrad24 they have been paid many times over. Actullay Polen invaded Sweden in 1500s we want money for that. It needs to stop this bullshit.

Krzysztof Kolber
Christer Landén did you paid us after deluge?


Corey John Stockdale
Clint Heine I mean Google is free not my job to teach you about the disalution of the russian empire and the ethnic cleansing of jewish people, ukranian and Hungarians that took place.


Christer Landén
Krzysztof Kolber are you that stupied that you dont get my point ? Polen got paid from Germany times over. It stops here. You see you pick any point in history and claim.


Krzysztof Kolber
Christer Landén when exacly did we get paid by Germany? Do you know the scale of destruction, how many poles were killed bt germans? When i have no information about something, im not trying to act if i know shit. You should do the same.


Bartosz Sowa
Edward Brett Very soon after Germans paid for WW 2nd.


Wojtek Vir
Christer Landén ale komu te pieniądze wypłacić? Przecież Szwedów już nie ma


Christer Landén

Tymoteusz Źrebiec
Corey John Stockdale we wanted independance and so we took it back with force.
123 years under foreign opression had to end at some point, and we dont feel slightly guilty about it.


Michal Zk
Christer Landén You are a 🤡 . What EU funding has to do with reparation? Poland is contributing to EU budget as well. On top of that Poland's market is open to European companies and especially in first 10 years EU got cheap labour too. So do not speak about something you don't understand


Piotr Bucholc
Christer Landén what ? 😂😂😂😂Sweden Invaded Poland ￼you were even stealing freaking monuments from the Castle in Warsaw a freaking co crete monuments 😆Sweden invaded Poland rubbing the country out of everything https://youtu.be/aqdrKEEt_nc?si=OYM_IowUrQRCs1CM


Andrzey Andreasos Chmurka
Idiots!!!


Cezary Lora
Christer Landén Historical facts from the Moomin Valley 🤣


Christer Landén
Mateusz Franczak I am Swede. We fund Polen like Germany so Polen can be net receiver in EU funds. We open up your borders so Poles could make money abroad. Before that you would still live among tve goats in Polan as during the Russian time of yours.

Jem Pizzę
Christer Landén you killed 40% our population (and you are proud of this), so you should pay and apologize


Christer Landén

Edytowano
Michał Lebioda
Christer Landén u stupid or What? Your country destroyed Poland more in XVII century than Nazis during WW2


Christer Landén
Jem Pizzę yes we are sorry but kind of stupied to attack Sweden. To what country should Polen pay and apologize to ? You attacked Sweden along with Russia 1700. Lithuania, Ukraine, Russia ? My point is this is never ending story. It needs to end


Edytowano
Christer Landén
Michał Lebioda but I as Swede do not owe YOU a shit ! Polen invaded Sweden in 1500s so bad idea. The fan hit you back


Tomasz Kaszteranda
many people defending Germans from the same countries that attacked us for centuries, Muslims will show you your place somewhere


Marek Czyzynski
Christer Landén what event do you mean exactly by Polish invasion of Sweden on 1500? Because I can't find ANY info regarding your claim


Christer Landén
Marek Czyzynski time back the school

Visegrad24 What do you mean... couldnt start without them.


Edvarts Zvirbulis
Visegrad24 What happened there? Why exactly would wanna annex it? Cause i heard polishjewish partisans commited genocide there, on germans... war rattling... i mean, England wanted it so bad.... uhhhh, all the idiots wanted it so bad..... for nearly 10 years Hitler wanted to calm all the idiots, no? How about you all start paying some mind... holocaust... thanks to the slightly excessive bombardment supply lines collapsed to the extent that everybody died in camps? No? Does not make sense... that is your holocaust... you are stupid. And whos fool are you>?
That is why we live in this fake clown world... pay. Idiots, you pay, everyday you pay.... life quality, firstly... and you also pay, with money too... to whom?
Now Poland knows communism very well, as they were first to get thrown under the bus meant for useful idiots, on a national scale.
Funny how evident is the corruption of the narrative... even AI cant straight up tell you something oh so crucial. WHY.
Hey, stupids, maybe start fighting each other over who gonna pay whom for what? Guess who would love that!?

Krzysztof Kolber tell me, how many were killed by Germans and how many by Russians? How many women were raped by Germans, how many by Russians? How many land were stolen by russians, and how many we got from Germans? How much politic of German were changed and how much by russia? How many german investitions and work place we have thanks to Germany and how many thanks to russia? How much money were given to Poland after joining UE and how much from russia?


Edvarts Zvirbulis
Visegrad24 Yeah, you should start paying... Poland. Because, as i heard, Hitler said, if they would lose, in a 100 years there wont be Europe. Well, 80 has passed... i think it is evident, and nothing really to theorize about.
I guess the untermenschen won... now you have streets filled with those in major euro citys, as degeneracy in normalized... congratz Poland, you look good now, in contrast. But are you really? Its amazing how much can a death of a good man change in the world... cause there was a man for peace with Germany, in Poland... but he died, too soon.
Too bad i cant give the quote, as i wiped my drive, but... the goal is to have a mass of people, too stupid to grasp anything, but good enough to work - that is a nice little marxist dream, euroasian negroid... also something about Europe never again competing for world domination... as if that is something to aspire to, as i think, the history shows the fate of empires, and the true cost can be comprehended.... but hey, there are retards out there, late to the party, and they wanna get some too!
The point of repentance, i guess, is to avoid a point that is too late, as Germany was... rest of the world was...

Rafał Karol
Christer Landén okay, so give back our national treasures that your great grandparents took from us in the 1600s


Cezary Lora
Christer Landén no, no, I just meant that he tells fairy tales.


Christer Landén
Jaroslaw Dankowski so what has that fo with this ? Learn your own history. Do you know many times Pimoland has attacked Sweden ? Before what you call Swdish deluge Poland had attacked Sweden 2 times. Last attacked was by Poland in 1700. So moron give to your fucking victimhood !


Cezary Lora
Christer Landén The Russian occupation of Ukraine and most of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania posed a threat to Swedish influence in the Baltic Sea and was the direct cause of the Swedish invasion of Poland and Lithuania in 1655. You should probably go back to school though 🤣


Wojtek Vir
Christer Landén w imieniu licznego i nie wymierającego narodu polskiego mówię: dziękuję


Cezary Lora
Christer Landén Dude, you can't even read with understanding and you're going to lecture me about history.


Cezary Lora
Christer Landén Poles never launched a full-scale invasion or raid on Swedish territory. Polish-Swedish conflicts in the 16th and 17th centuries (including the Swedish Deluge of 1655–1660) were fought primarily over Livonia and influence in the Baltic Sea basin, with fighting usually taking place on Polish, Lithuanian, or Livonia lands. I recommend eating less butter because it's bad for your memory 🤣


Milewski Paweł
Chris Colebrook 1655 1660 5 y war. 40% of Poland destroyed and 50% of the valubales stolen.


Edytowano
Cezary Lora
Christer Landén From us, the only reparations you can get are those that Stefan Czarniecki presented to you.


Jaroslaw Dankowski
Christer Landén Learn history. It was Sweden that attacked Poland, learn about the deluge, how much you robbed us. Pimoland? Did someone ever kicked your ass? Come over and we can talk live about who the moron is. Your country soon will be muslim land and then you will plead to come over to Poland. BTW, the deluge was before 1700. The swedish school seems not to be top in terms of history (and obviously math), that explains a lot.


Piotr Suda
Marek Czyzynski He meant what we call Potop Szwedzki. It's closest to 1500s we have any war with Sweden.


Edytowano
Piotr Bartnicki
Edward Brett So the Jews must pay much higher compensation to Poland for treason in the eastern territories, pointing out local elites to the Soviet occupiers, for the massacres of the villages of Koniuchy and Naliboki (in the context of Jedwabne) and for the post-war management of Stalinist crimes, torture and murder of Polish war heroes (in the context of the Kielce pogrom).


Piotr Makarewicz
Christer Landén the reason is very simple, Poland has never signed any agreement with Germany, not counting the puppet government during communism. Besides, my friend, Sweden destroyed and took more from Poland than Germany did during World War II. So most of exhibits
in the museum in Stockholm that you can see are stolen from Poland.Germany pays compensation to Jews and pensions to SS men to this day. I see no reason for them to finally settle their accounts with the Poles. Ta hand om dig


Christer Landén
Jaroslaw Dankowski yrs about the so called deluge. You learn to read. The wars PRIOR to that Poland attacked Sweden twice as well as the last one 1700. But idiot you are missing the point here. Poland has NO fucking right of war reperations after 80 years from Germany. If you claim that you are moron.


Christer Landén
Piotr Makarewicz soo what IDIOT it is over 300 years ago ! Remember last war we had Poland attacked Sweden and again you were defeated. My point is war reperations for Poland....fucking forget it !


Jaroslaw Dankowski
Christer Landén Honey, Poland didn't invade Sweden, nothing excuses the Deluge. Give us back what you stole. Learn that an intelligent man uses arguments, not insults. Ah, Yes, an intelligent man, you're neither of this. Of course we have right to demand reparations from Germany and yes, from Swedistan as well.

Germany finished paying reperations to France, England etc for WW I in 2010. Poland the main victim of WW II never got a penny. This subject will never be solved any other way than by financial responsibility.


Dominik Picek
But its been now 80 years... Should England get reparations for Norman invasion of 1066??


Zbigniew Golemienko
Dominik Picek kid, 80 years is not ancient history, my grandma lived through the war and occupations and she is still alive. As i said, Germany was done paying reperations for WW I in 2010. What do you not comprehend?


Dominik Picek
Zbigniew Golemienko That you still had to go on about this... And I setiously dont care about your grandma as much as you dont care about mine... Tired of this nonsense, its like when we constantly talk about Lidice and Lezaky even though nobody cares anyomore


Zbigniew Golemienko
Dominik Picek ah sorry, i didnt know you are tired, i will call president to tell him to cut it out! 😃

Max V. Thiereck
ahahaha joke of the week, it got paid already. also if you dont believe it look up the contracts. but since we are on the topic- since we should pay more reparations do we get back our territories than ? would be fair no ? or are we cherry picking again ?


Zbigniew Golemienko
Max V. Thiereck i think that the easiest solution is the german way. Poles and French should genocide germans and then the land will be ours. Oldest settlements in eastern Germany were already Slavic before. Then we will finally get rid of the troyan horse, the enemy within.


Wojt Wojt
Max V. Thiereck when Poles speak about IIWW the only role of a german is to kneel and say: I'm sorry, yes, yes, you're right, I'm sorry, yes.

Margaret Surovietz then Poland should as Russia to return the money. In exchange for the money they spent in Poland.

Zbigniew Golemienko
Petr Vrublevskyii may tell you that Poland repayed Czech for their invasion on Poland in 1920 😃 ukraine is in a pickle because its a made up country with no statehood continuity so your victims during war were also Polish citizens.

Albert M Michejda Yeah, but if they did the same to Russia there would be a risk of Russia actually reacting, and that's what they really don't want lol. It's just empty talking to get people gullible enough to vote for them, and this is the easy way. They always only attack Germany because "evil Germany" will never actually bite back for the threats, and will keep cooperating peacefully with Poland even if they get called killers and dictators everyday.

Annexed by Germany from Poland hundreds years ago


Jan Kowalski
Piotr Moskala Poland wasn’t exist for longer time than exist today. On the same principle of thinking Silesia can be reborn and take their lands. Or Prussia, or maybe Czechs will demand Wratislav?
The Poland as a country not Kingdom, exist only 108 years. And in that time when we finally have administration, and nation ( there was no polish nation concept before 1918) and we start to exist on maps, we didnt poses lands on north and west. It was given to us after WW2. This lands belonged to Germany. But after 1918 we have had lands on east. It was taken from us by USSR. And now we can discuss if this lands were occupied by polish kingdom or belonged to us, etc. The same arguments and claims over the centuries can make Poland greater or disapear at all.
It’s a lie and a myth that these are reclaimed lands. These are lands obtained as REPARATIONS after WW2. And today’s claims from centuries ago of the descendants of slaves who were just livestock as chicken or pig, are ridiculous and cringy.


Piotr Moskala
Poza tym , że jesteś historycznym nieukiem to ok. Lekarz już czeka.

Jan Kowalski widzę kolega w polskim interesie rozpoczął negocjacje


Jan Kowalski
Paweł Kurkowski w Polskim interesie to jest utrzymywać jak najlepsze stosunki z naszym zachodnim sąsiadem. Plucie na Niemcy i Ukrainę przy jednoczesnej wojnie na wschodzie i snucie ruskich narracji o wyjściu z Unii, to przepis na oczywistą katastrofę. Już to przerabialiśmy i zniknęliśmy ze świata na ponad 120 lat. Dziś idziemy w tym samym kierunku. Znowu pseudopatrioci z głupoty lub za ruble pchają nas w łapy ruskich.
Polacy są odklejeni ze swoimi mitami i to się skończy dla wszystkich Polaków tragicznie. Nie będę miał satysfakcji, twierdząc „a nie mówiłem”, kiedy tak do siebie zbrzydzimy zachodnią Europę, że wszyscy machną na nas ręką kiedy Polska stanie się drugą Białorusią. A stanie się, jeśli większość będzie dalej pluć na zachód bardziej, zamiast zacząć odrobinę myśleć jaka przyszłość nas czeka poza UE.

Jan Kowalski
Paweł Kurkowski I zobaczysz, że Poznań, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Szczecin, Bydgoszcz i zapewne górny Śląsk nie zechcą być w ruskiej orbicie. Więc Polacy ani nie dostaną reparacji od Niemców a jeszcze z pocałowaniem ręki sami zechcą stać się ich częścią jeśli homo sovieticus ze wschodu stwierdzą że u ruskich jest fajniej. Dokładnie to miało miejsce przed rozbiorami. I dokładnie tak samo zaściankowe, tchórzliwe i zdradzieckie tendencje Polaków do rozbiorów doprowadziły.

**Auschwitz – a German death camp and the first prisoners (1940–1941)**
Auschwitz was a **German concentration camp and death camp**, established and run by the Germans on occupied Polish territories. From the very beginning it served as an instrument of terror against the Polish population, and only later became the main site of the extermination of European Jews.
The first transport of prisoners arrived at Auschwitz on **14 June 1940**. It consisted of **728 Poles** brought from the prison in Tarnów. This day is regarded as the beginning of the camp’s operation. In the years **1940–1941, mainly Poles were sent to Auschwitz**, as the camp was intended to break the resistance of Polish society and destroy its elites.
**In the period 1940–1941, those imprisoned and murdered there were primarily Poles:**
* members of the Polish resistance movement
* Polish soldiers of the September Campaign
* the Polish intelligentsia: teachers, students, clergy, officials
* Polish scouts and youth
* Poles accused of “anti-German activity”
Poles were murdered through **executions, starvation, disease, exhausting forced labor, and torture**. Auschwitz functioned as a **German camp of terror and extermination**, whose aim was to intimidate and subjugate the Polish nation.
Only from **1942**, after the expansion of the camp with Birkenau, did Auschwitz become a site of mass, industrial extermination of Jews. However, its first victims were Poles, and the beginnings of the camp are inseparably linked with German policies of crimes against Poland. #GermanDeathCamps


Andrzey Andreasos Chmurka
Exactly




Randy Busch
Then what?


Wolf Kreft
Thats how the last one started


Piotr Guzik
per GROK:
"Since the year 966, Poland has never launched a major, unprovoked invasion deep into core German territory for conquest; Polish offensives were typically defensive counterattacks, border recoveries (e.g., against Teutonic incursions), or limited frontier actions. In total, there have been roughly 8–12 major named wars or prolonged conflict series (depending on how one groups phases and border skirmishes), with Germans/German states as the aggressor in most large-scale invasions or territorial seizures, while Poland occasionally initiated limited campaigns for western border security or tribute. The pattern reflects Poland's vulnerable position between powerful western (German) and eastern (Russian) neighbors, with the 1939 invasion and WWII occupation marking the peak of devastation."

59 min

Piotr Guzik
Rob Fairley per GROK:
"The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's full-scale invasion of Russia in 1609 (starting with the siege of Smolensk under King Sigismund III Vasa) was primarily prompted by Tsar Vasili IV Shuisky's military alliance with Sweden (signed February 28, 1609), which Sigismund viewed as a direct threat to Polish interests—especially his own ambitions to reclaim the Swedish throne (as a Vasa dynasty member deposed from Sweden)—while also exploiting Russia's ongoing Time of Troubles (civil chaos, famine aftermath, pretender crises like the False Dmitrys, and boyar factions) to pursue territorial gains (e.g., recovering Smolensk and other borderlands lost earlier), weaken a potential Swedish ally, and install Sigismund himself or his son Władysław on the Russian throne for greater influence or even a personal union. Earlier Polish involvement (via private noble support for the False Dmitrys from 1605–1609) had been opportunistic and unofficial, but the Swedish-Russian pact gave Sigismund the pretext and Sejm approval for open royal intervention in September 1609.

Throughout modern history 3 groups suffered more than any others. Blacks, Jews and Poles. They are very much the same in what they have in common. They all want money, deserved or not, from others for events that happened before those asking for the money, or providing the money, were even born.
Perhaps it's time to understand why those similar groups are treated as such solely to prevent future hardships.


Nikola Petrovic
Okay but then Poland returns Silesia, Pomerania, Masuria and Lubusz Voivodeships to Germany. If that's not reparation I don't know what it is. This is hypocricy, really


Zbigniew Golemienko
Nikola Petrovic thats not how it works xD Poland after WW II is smaller than it was before it, and just because germans commited genocides before in history and eradicted Baltic Prussians doesnt exactly give them moral high ground to claim those lands xD oldest cities in eastern Germany were built around Polabian strongholds.


Nikola Petrovic
Zbigniew Golemienko Did Poland payed reparations to Russia because of occupation of Moscow in 1613? I mean, if we are guiding ourselves with that logic, you should pay it. Silesia and Pomerania were ethnically German, you sent those people to Germany, cleansed the area, and you got much better land than that land in the east. Also eastern Poland pre WWII was not ethnically Polish at all. Only Lwiw and Wilno and their surounding. If Germany is to pay Poland reparations for WW2, then why not paying every nation? They ravaged my country also, Serbia!


Clint Heine
Nikola Petrovic Germany has given reparations to Namibia. So there is precedent. And are you comparing the occupation of Moscow to the Holocaust? That would be daft.

Emil Radoński
Nikola Petrovic Poland received these western territories because it lost its eastern territories to Russia. Do you know what reparations are? 500,000 works of art and culture were taken away by the Germans in wagons and never returned, the reconstruction of Warsaw, millions of victims and cripples, thousands of people in forced labour in camps... I despise idiots like you!


Nikola Petrovic
Emil Radoński My country went through the same. I think it's completely ignorant i idiotic to go back to 1940s and ask for reparations from the country you took land from which amounts half of your country now. I mean really. I think it's only right wing polish propaganda, this reparations, to keep nationalists happy and proud. Russia did the same thing during Polish uprisings in the 19. century and in partitions in 18th. Ask them also.


Damyan Danev
Emil Radoński Russia did not exist as an independent state then. The territories you are talking about today are part of Belarus and Ukraine.


Damyan Danev
Today's Germans will answer that at that time their ancestors lived in the deserts and semi-deserts of the Middle East, Arabia and the rocks of Turkey.




Ola Nowak
Nikola Petrovic ask Stalin, Churchil and Roosvelt, they made decision in Jalta after WWII to divide East Europe and they decided the borders. Poland has had huge lands before WWII in the east and USSR overtook the land. Would you take back Lithuania, Belarus and West Ukraine back to Poland ?


Jack Biernack
Ola Nowak please tell us what land is Polish , German, Russian etc of course from everyone’s perspective.




Peter Rymasz
Nikola Petrovic Not really. Slavic tribes settled in Pomerania in the 5th-6th century. Pomerania comes from the Slavic Language "po more - eng. by the sea". Then the Piast dynasty (Polish) ruled Silesia and Pomerania in the 10th-11th centuries until it was colonised by Czech, Germans and Austrians, who had always tried to conquer these regions violently.

Zbigniew Golemienko
Nikola Petrovic i dont know who raised you to be a german cuckold but Pomerania and Silesia literally have their own distinct dialects/languages which are Slavic and both survived exactly because local population was fighting against germanization so much. There is still small population of original inhabitants of modern day saxony who, surprise, also speak very old Slavic language. There is no point in discussing someone with his cuckold agenda though.


Nikola Petrovic
Zbigniew Golemienko Nope you're wrong. Im just saying you're the hypocrites now, im not siding with the Germans, I'll always be by your side.




Zbigniew Golemienko
Nikola Petrovic if someone wants reperations from Poland they may ask for it. You are wrong by claiming Poland has no rights to reperations. And your argumentation is pure retardation.


Krzysztof A. Ziembik
Nikola Petrovic Poland was pushed to get Silesia, Pomerania, Masuria and Lubusz Voivodeships by USSR. This wasn't compensation from Germany. The USSR simply gave back larger and better Polish lands in the East in exchange for the stolen lands. The Germans settled accounts with the USSR, but not with us.


Zbigniew Golemienko
Krzysztof A. Ziembik exactly, the eastern lands are where all the farming takes place. Also reperations are not about land but about paying off for all things stolen, all things turned to rubble, all those people murdered etc. There are Polish stolen paintings comming out on auctions all the time.


Sven Kunert
Zbigniew Golemienko Then you shouldnt have signed the paper in 1953. But you did. So the topic reparations is closed and over.


Jan Polak
Krzysztof A. Ziembik Otherwise true, but what "better" lands are you talking about? The East had the best farming areas in the world, which are still being fought over.

Chris Colebrook Listen, there were never any Polish concentration camps in real life. They were GERMAN concentration camps built by the Germans in then-occupied Poland. Millions of Poles and Jews lost their lives at German hands. German institutions and corrupt politicians deliberately distort these words. Instead of saying "German" death camps, they say "Polish" and then apologize, saying it was an accident. These are the first attempts to distort history.


Chris Colebrook
Marek Ankudowicz so where was Auschwitz then?


Agnieszka Jagiello
Chris Colebrook go back to school!


Chris Colebrook
Agnieszka Jagiello is that because that's where you are?


Agnieszka Jagiello
Chris Colebrook who built the camps? Was Poland an independent country? Polish people build them to murder other Polish people? Are you serious? Germans built the first death camps in Namibia, so they were Namibian, according to this logic....And if you use the phrase "Polish camps" it implies the ownership not the location.
You miss the point. They were death camps!


Katarzyna Gębka
Chris Colebrook the fact that concentration camp Auschwitz was built on OCCUPIED TERRITORIES doesn't make ot Polish, as it was fully built and administrated by GERMANY. I know you may become wet when you think about Mengele or Hoess but they were Germans, they are responsible for the death of about 6 millions innocent people, they brought a war to Polish land, Holocaust was GERMAN idea and GERMAN invention. It's 21 centiry and I am still shocked when ignorant can't find sources and understand the circumstances.

Ussr controlled Poland after ww2 didnt it? So the reperations, which also includes money meant for Poland, was taken by kremlin. That also includes my country money. All reperations went to moscow bank. As for work of art and monuments, there i could agree with you.


Conrad Wyszomirski
Andris Avotiņš Yes, because Stalin made Roosevelt and Churchill look like idiots and took Poland, bulgaria, and hungary and some other countries and forced communism on them. Had Truman let Patton go into Moscow and destroy Russia like he wanted, Poland would of been free after 1945 along with the others.

Bogusław Paź
Andris Avotiņš Germany invaded Poland and murdered 6 million Poles, so Poland was and is the recipient of reparations. If Germany paid these reparations to someone else, it is Germany's problem, not Poland's. And they can ask the Germans to return the money to the Russians, not Poland.


Andris Avotiņš
Bogusław Paź A thing is that after ww2 nobody talked with Poland about reperations. Ussr together with other Allies simply put a check on a table and it was signed. So a money, that was also meant for Poland recovery, was given to ussr, cos Poland was under ussr direct control. In that way ussr was responsible to invest reperations to recover all those teritories, that was destroyed in a war. Wasnt Poland rebuilt under ussr? So if there is some doubts on how honest that reperations was spent, i think most logical would be to ask kremlin about it, cos Germany paid a price, that was asked. Germany didnt even had the option to directly pay Poland or any other ussr controlled teritory. So why should Germany pay once more to Poland, just cos kremlin didnt share reperations?

Many Jews that survived left the country for the US and Israel- and were compensated for the rubble left behind. Some stayed to rebuild. Compensation was fair and complete.

Dawid Jenerał
Aspen Dunn Germany is not a brother, the only thing they want is to squeeze money out of every single UE member. When war is over, they will make business with Russia again. Remember Nord stream 2? Think about it. Every single country that was attacked by Germany got reparations beside Poland. They killed 3 milions of poles, robbed thousands of art pieces, gold and gave nothing back. Did not even pay a single euro to the people that survived the horror they made to them and you tell us something about brotherhood? Don’t be a fool. If one single occasion comes they will turn their back to us.


Aspen Dunn
You’re talking about the existing government, not the people. Of course the governments of Europe are destroying us.

Did they ever return to their original places, where they were stolen from? Tell me why works of art still hang in the former fascist German homes of all these perpetrators.

During World War II, the German occupation of Poland involved the systematic looting of cultural, artistic, and economic assets, with a significant portion transported to Germany by rail.
Total Rail Transport of Loot: While a precise, single number for all stolen goods is difficult to isolate, estimations indicate that during the early phase of the occupation, 10,000 train wagons filled with stolen property—including agricultural machinery, furniture, food, and other goods—were sent to Germany by the Wehrmacht by early November 1939.
Art and Cultural Theft: Over 516,000 individual items of art and historical value were taken from Poland.
Library and Document Losses: Approximately 22 million books and documents were lost or destroyed, with vast quantities of library collections and archives taken by the occupiers.
Scope of Plunder: The plunder included 11,000 paintings by Polish artists, 2,800 European paintings, 1,500 sculptures, 75,000 manuscripts, 25,000 maps, and 300,000 prints.
Gold and Valuables: The Nazis systematically looted banks and private collections, including gold, jewelry, and silver, often as part of the "Aktion Reinhard" campaign, with these items frequently transported by train.
Total Looting Statistics: Some estimates suggest that 43% of Poland's cultural artifacts were looted. Furthermore, reports of broader Nazi looting across Europe mention 1,418,000 railway wagons and 427,000 tonnes by ship in total.
The so-called "Nazi gold train" (or Wałbrzych gold train), often rumored to have carried vast treasures, is considered an urban legend by many historians, though it is symbolic of the massive, recorded theft of valuables from Poland.

Lars Garnichda
So when will Poland finally pay for stealing the land of my forefathers in the 5th and 6th century when slavs moved to central Europe? After they payed for that and endless slavic raids on their neighbours we can speak about WW2.


Angelika Zofia
Lars Garnichda shut up german schwein


Tomasz Puchalski
Lars Garnichda The entire Brandenburg region was the land of the Lusatian Slavs, it was not previously Germanic land. The Germans had a policy of settling the land and considering it theirs.


Lars Garnichda
Tomasz Puchalski Read a book mate. Read a book about where slavs came from. Spoiler: it was not Brandenburg.

"who settled around the middle Havel river in the present-day Havelland region of Brandenburg in eastern Germany from the 8th century onwards."




Wojciech Herbich
Lars Garnichda any idea what happened to these territories and their Slavic/Lechitic/Polish inhabitants between the Xth and XXIst century? Yeah, I figured you had no fucking clue.


Lars Garnichda
Wojciech Herbich They got pushed out of land they stole before? Bu-hu-hu.




Tomasz Puchalski
Lars Garnichda After all, you Germans not only murdered people, not only Jews, you murdered Gypsies, Poles, Russians, you murdered prisoners of war, mentally ill people. You robbed, you took away works of art, gold, silver, furniture, bricks in railway carriages, you robbed entire nations, not only Poles, you started two world wars in the world, you were the largest barbaric, cruel group in the Roman Empire. You are responsible for two world wars. You have racism in your blood, you have hatred. You are the ones who exalt yourselves as a super race, you consider yourselves a superior race. Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, said about you that Germany, as an example, should be bombed every 50 years, as an example. You are the greatest pests of all of Europe, together with communist Russia. Germany has brought the greatest evil to all of Europe. You are responsible for the greatest misfortune. You have brought death, destruction, death to millions of people all over the world, not only to Jews, but you brought World War II to Europe. Give back to Poland the German thieves the works of art, gold, silver, tableware, furniture, marble that you stole. You barbarian thieves, the Germans, have smuggled out of the museums of Poland and Europe in railway carriages. And now you have brought the Fourth Reich to Europe in the guise of the European Union, robbing all of Europe economically.

The one who starts the war has to pay. Also to his own citizens. Nothing is free in the world we live in. If you want war, or start inner conflict within your own country, again you have to pay the cost. This is for the governors.

The old Nazis are almost all dead and gone. No one running the democratic country of Germany today were even alive during WW2. Same with Poland, no one running Poland today were even alive back then.
